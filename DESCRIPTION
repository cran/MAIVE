Description: 
    Meta-analysis traditionally assigns more weight to studies with lower standard errors,
    assuming higher precision. However, in observational research, precision must be
    estimated and is vulnerable to manipulation, such as p-hacking, to achieve statistical
    significance. This can lead to spurious precision, invalidating inverse-variance
    weighting and bias-correction methods like funnel plots. Common methods for addressing
    publication bias, including selection models, often fail or exacerbate the problem.
    This package introduces an instrumental variable approach to limit bias caused by
    spurious precision in meta-analysis. Methods are described in 'Irsova et al.' (2025)
